Every file needed is in the Weather_and_Vacation file.
The csv file with cities is there.
My four figures of scatterplots are also there.
My two notebooks are in there.
Every file I have worked on has "dr" in the name because of my initials.
Comments are in both notebooks describing the function of the sections of code.
My brief descriptions of the scatter plots in "WeatherPy_dr" are commented out and discuss both north and south hemispheres.
